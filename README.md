Code driving the Menagerie Mechanique,an art project brought to Burning Man in 2012.

It consisted of 10 free standing frames holding a musical instrument, which could be struck by a solenoid controlled by an ATmega168.

It also controlled lights to display bar and beat and read a piezoelectric pad that people could tap to cause the solenoid to strike.

These interactions were recorded and played back in time, creating a life sized sequencer.
