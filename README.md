# Menagerie Mechanique (aka xylona)

Code driving the Menagerie Mechanique,an art project brought to Burning Man in 2012.

It consisted of 10 free standing frames holding a musical instrument, each with a solenoid to strike it, and controlled by an ATmega168.

It also controlled lights to display bar and beat and read a piezoelectric pad that people could tap to cause the solenoid to strike.

These interactions were recorded and played back in time, creating a life sized sequencer. ([project photos](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOt5jST6vyfsu4qz6gcR1yQPQZlNgq6wanmN5UHsi2HxRaH1dKQghDKV_oR2bQyHA))
